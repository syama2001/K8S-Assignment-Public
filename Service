1) We need to check Replica Set Label and Node Port Service  Labels are matching 

2)kubectl get rs -o wide
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl get svc -o wide  ->Node Port is Mounted Correctly 
kubectl get ep -o wide 

With the above commands  ensure Replica set is created and Node Port is mounted correctly.

2)do Kubectl describe svc/<NodePortServiceName>  and check the IP and try to access it from inside the cluster using curl command
curl <IP:TcpPort>

 If 
	accessible Go to step 3 
 Else
	Check in NodeportSVC  
				- port: <80>
					targetPort: <8080>
	are mentioned right,Node Port specified correctly and externalTrafficPolicy is not mentioned as local. 

3)Check curl localhost:<nodePort> is working or not 
4)From external network , We need use the Public IP to access the Node Port.
