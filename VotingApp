Delete voting Pod : It came up and the Voting app interface shows the new container ID
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Delete Worker node : I coulde see that Voting app resumed working after worker pod comeup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Delete  DB node : I could see Result and worker node started showing error and restarted as  DB node is not available to Push or Pull the data.
These two nodes has dependency  to the DB node.
