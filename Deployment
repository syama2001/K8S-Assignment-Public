We can use Rolling Update Strategy in which it will slowly replace the pod of previous version of the application with instance of new version of application without downtime.

We can use below for rolling Update Strategy as we have only one pod running

As per below During a Rolling Update operation,it will create a new Pod, bringing the total to 2.
By setting the maxUnavailable to zero, k8s  never let any Pod be unavailable, even if that means surging Pods above the replica count for a short time

  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 2
      maxUnavailable: 0
